                    We believe legal terms should be clear, not confusing. These
                    Terms of Service explain how you can use our products and
                    what we expect from each other. We've tried to keep the
                    legalese to a minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using any Coryso product or service, you're agreeing to
                    these terms. If something doesn't make sense, please reach
                    out—we're happy to clarify.
                </p>

                    Coryso Studio develops and maintains software products
                    including browser extensions, productivity tools, themes,
                    and related services. Our products are provided "as is" with
                    the goal of being useful and reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of our products are currently free to use. For any paid
                    products or services, pricing and terms will be clearly
                    stated before purchase.

                    You're free to use our products for personal or commercial
                    purposes, as long as you:

                    >
                    unless it's explicitly open source. We put care into
                    building these tools—please respect that work.

                <p>
                    For products that store data locally (like Nookmark), you

                    We build software with care, but we can't guarantee
                    perfection. Our products are provided without warranties of
                    any kind, express or implied.

                <p>
                    <strong>We don't guarantee uninterrupted service.</strong>
                    Software breaks sometimes. We'll do our best to fix issues
                    quickly, but we can't promise zero downtime.

                    <strong>Use at your own risk.</strong> While we strive to
                    build reliable tools, you're responsible for how you use
                    them and any consequences that result.

                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Coryso LLC and its
                    developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,

                </p>
                <p>
                    For paid products or services, our total liability is
                    limited to the amount you paid us in the past 12 months.

                <p>
                    For significant changes, we'll make reasonable efforts to
                    notify users. Continued use of our products after changes
                    means you accept the updated terms.

                    Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Sheridan
                    County, Wyoming, or through good-faith discussion—we prefer
                    the latter.
