                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Last updated: October 23, 2025</p>
            </header>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Our Approach</div>
                <p>
                    At Coryso Studio, we believe privacy isn't a feature—it's the foundation of thoughtful software. This Privacy Policy reflects our commitment to building tools that respect you as a person, not just as a user.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">What We Don't Collect</div>
                <p>
                    We take privacy seriously because we value our own privacy too. We don't collect any personal information from visitors to our website. No cookies, no tracking pixels, no analytics that identify you. Nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website and products work without monitoring your behavior, selling your data, or building profiles of who you are. That's not how thoughtful tools should work.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">What We Do Value</div>
                <p>
                    While we don't collect personal data, we do value something deeply: your trust. We build software that works because it's useful, not because it knows everything about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your focus should be on your work, your creativity, your thoughts—not on worrying about who's watching. That's the simple philosophy behind everything we build.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Local Storage</div>
                <p>
                    Some of our tools (like Nookmark) store data locally on your device—in your browser, using Chrome's built-in storage. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it. It's your information, controlled by you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">No Third Parties</div>
                <p>
                    Since we don't collect your data, we don't share it with anyone either. No advertising networks, no data brokers, no third-party analytics. The only person with access to your data is you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Changes</div>
                <p>
                    Our commitment to privacy is fundamental, so we don't anticipate changes that would compromise this approach. If we ever update this policy, we'll post the changes here—not because you need to worry, but because transparency matters.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Questions?</div>
                <p>
                    Privacy shouldn't be complicated, but sometimes questions come up. If you have any about how our tools work or our approach to privacy, we're happy to talk about it.
